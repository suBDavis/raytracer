======================================== Build Requirements =====================================
|
|   + Any OS with a BASH shell
|   + The g++ compiler (I used version 5.2.1)
|       * Can be installed on ubuntu-based systems via "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
|   + An image viewer that supports the .ppm format
|       * Alternatively, use imagemagick to create a .png from the .ppm output
|       * "sudo apt-get install imagemagick"
|       * "cd Images"
|       * "./convert.sh"
|   + OpenGL is NOT required.
|
======================================= Description of Parts ====================================
|
|   This project is build from a few components:
|   + A room, which contains:
|       * Drawables: these implement an intersect function and a getOrtho, which returns an orthogonal ray for any point in space.
|           - Sphere
|           - Plane
|           - Each drawable has a PhongProp - Phong properties that the tracer will use to compute lighting
|       * A camera: a point in threespace to make the origin of each ray.
|       * Any number of lights, each of which will be computed spearately in the trace function.
|       * A View window: Can be set to any 3 coplanar points in space.  
|       * The room will generate initial camera rays based on the camera and view window
|   + The Tracer, which only implements perspective tracing but could be easily refactored to allow for orthographic tracing.
|       * Tracer logic: check if a camera ray has any intersections, then compute lighting for the closest intersect point it finds.
|   + The Renderer, which encapsulates antialiasing and image resolution.  
|       * The same room can be passed twice to the same tracer with different renderers to get either
|           - Different resolutions
|           - A different representation of the room (i.e. the ASCII preview you see)
|   + Helper Classes such as
|       * Color: normalized at the end of rendering based on the global min and max 
|       * Vector3: used for both vectors and points
|       * Ray: Which wraps a vector and a point together, and is the basic unit for checking intersection
